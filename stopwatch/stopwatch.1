.SH LIMITATIONS
The timer is only as accurate as the operating system permits us to be with our
sleep system calls. Under heavy system load, the operating system reserves the
right to make us sleep for longer than we requested, but never less. So, your
timer will always be correct in ideal conditions, but may record a value less
than the true one in some circumstances.
